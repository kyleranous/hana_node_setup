# HANA Node Setup Script
<B>NOTE! Script is not yet ready to run and has not been fully tested. If you pull this script now, make sure you go through it and update the script as needed!</b>


This is the setup script for the HANA swarm created as part of [this](https://kranous.com/projects/home-automation/) tutorial. 

### Use
Fork this script into your own repository. Make sure you update the JOIN SWARM section with the worker/manager join commands generated by your swarm. 
When you first log onto the pi, clone the script to your desktop and run with appropriate arguments.

### Running
Script requires 2 arguments, a swarm join type and a hostname. <br>
<ex>
ex:<br>
```sudo sh node_setup.sh -w hana05```<br>
Will setup the node as a worker with the hostname 'hana05'

To setup as a worker run with: -w or --worker

To setup as a manager run with: -m or --manager
